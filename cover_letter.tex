\opening{Dear Dr. Govender,}


The purpose of this letter is to submit a proposal for the creation of
the Andean Regional Office of Astronomy for Development (ROAD). If the
proposal is successful, we expect to have a functional node starting
on January 1st 2014. 

This node will encompass six countries: Bolivia, Chile, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. The main initiative for this proposal has
been lead by several institutions in Colombia, Venezuela and
Ecuador. The current form of this proposal is the result of meetings
and discussions started in 2012. 

Attached to this letter you will find the full body of the proposal
(16 pages) and two support letters on behalf of the ROAD Coordinator and the
Task Force 2 Coordinator.

We look forward to receiving the reply of the OAD steering committee
to our proposal.


\closing{Sincerely,}
