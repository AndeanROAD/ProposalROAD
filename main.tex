\title{Proposal towards the establishment of an Andean Regional Office of
  Astronomy for Development} 
\date{September 12, 2014}

\section{Rationale}

The countries in the Andean Region (Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador,
Peru and Venezuela) represent a common language block in South
America. They share similar social conditions and goals for scientific
and cultural development.  

The astronomical development in each of these countries can be
efficiently achieved through regional cooperation. With the leadership
of Chile and Venezuela in aspects of professional astronomy and
Colombia for public outreach, it is possible to develop strategies to
strengthen the professional research, education and popularization of
astronomy in the Andean region. This development effort requires the
commitment and shared effort from different institutions. 

An Andean Regional Office of Astronomy for Development (ROAD) can
serve this goal.  It will strengthen ongoing collaboration efforts,
create channels of communication and develop new strategies to
exchange knowledge and human resources in the region.  


The participating institutions have been involved in different
projects in each one of the ROAD core areas: research, schools and
children and public \footnote{For instance, in the outreach and children activities
  the following programs have been active during the last years: Astronomy Olympiads, Galileo Teacher Training
  Program (GTTP), the Network for Astronomy School Education (NASE)
  and Universe Awareness (UNAWE), Galileo Mobile, CERE S'COOL, Rocks
  Around the World, Eratosthenes, Galileoscope, Dark Sky Awareness,
  Astronomers without borders, From Earth to the Universe,
  International Space Week, Galileo Nights and Asteroid Search
  Campaigns.}. However, the participation and degree of commitment
has not been homogeneous across the region, or even inside the same
country. 

Therefore our {\bf main goal is to guarantee and strengthen effective
  methods of communication between the representatives and
  coordinators of global, regional and local projects} implemented  in
the Andean countries, specially looking to orient and advise new
working groups in  other cities and regions. This lead us to define
the following objectives.


\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Foster the goals of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Strategic Plan in the Andean region
\item
Serve as partner to the Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD), the IAU and other international
organizations to plan and implement relevant projects in the Andean
region. 
\item
Create public forums where the project management of all development
activities can be communicated and evaluated. 
\item
Initiate and coordinate fund-raising activities for regional
development activities. 
\item
Create new institutional alliances among countries in the region to
exchange knowledge and human resources. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Core Values}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Balance. The ROAD projects must have a balance among different areas
(research, education, outreach) and target countries. 
\item
Without borders. Priority will be given to projects that involve two
or more ROAD countries. 
\item
Transparency. All Andean ROAD projects will be transparent to the
public in their conception, execution and evaluation. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Core functions of the Executive Board}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Decide on the acceptance of new collaborators to the Andean ROAD.
\item Create an annual action plan for the Andean ROAD.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Organizing committees}

There will be three organizing committees, one for each Task
Force. We aim to have one person from each country in the
Andean ROAD. Members in that committee must belong to one of the
Collaborating Institutions. The ROAD coordinator and the specific Task
Force coordinator will also take part in the decision making process of each
committee. The committee members will be renewed every year. The
coordinators should stay in their role at most for one year and a
half. 

\subsection*{Core functions of the organizing committees}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Collect the basic information required to create annual action
  plan in line with the IAU Strategic Plan and the needs expressed by
  the Institutions composing the Andean ROAD. 
\item Decide on the priority of projects to be implemented in the
  annual action plan. 
\item Track the progress with the leaders of each project in the
  annual action plan and the IAU Strategic plan. 
\item Pursue new collaborations or organize activities with existing
  or emerging institutions both domestically (at the level of each
  ROAD’s country) and internationally. 
 \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Andean ROAD Collaborators}


Only institutions (Universities, Research Institutes, Research
Divisions, Planetariums, Museums) or professional associations are
considered as collaborators of the Andean ROAD. 

Individuals can join the Andean ROAD as volunteers. In this group we
in mind four major groups. (1) undergraduate/graduate students in the
ROAD countries, (2) graduate students and postdoctoral researchers
nationals of the Andean region working abroad, (3) school teachers
working in the ROAD countries and (4) any volunteer willing to support
the goals of the Andean ROAD regardless of their country of origin. 


\subsection*{Process to join the Andean ROAD}

Institutions must direct a one page Letter of Intent (LoI) to the
members of the Executive Board stating their intention to join the
Andean ROAD and naming one (1) person of contact. Once this petition
is approved unanimously by the Executive Board, a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) will be signed between the new collaborating Institution
and the Responsible Institution. In order to accept the application
every TF1 institution must have TF2/TF3 partner institution,
and viceversa each TF2/TF3 must have a TF1 partner in the same
country. 

There are three reasons to have these conditions. First, we want to
foster lasting processes over the ROAD lifetime; this motivates us to
have institutions, not individuals, as ROAD collaborators. Second, we want
to avoid previous experiences whereby an individual or an institution
act on a covert way on the name of whole national communities; this
motivates the two stage (Loi+MoU) process. Third, we want to motivate
direct collaboration between institutions with different backgrounds
(TF1 and TF2-TF3) to ensure a balance across task forces; this
motivates the partnering mechanism.  

Volunteers only have to express their interest to become
collaborators. They are not limited to live in the Andean ROAD
countries. The Executive Board will enable a tool to reach volunteers
as they are needed to implement different programs.  

\subsection*{The role of Chile in the Andean ROAD}

Due to the large size of the Chilean professional astronomical
community and its special role in global astronomy its important to
spell out in detail the role of Chile in the collaboration

The most important aspect is that all the interaction to coordinate
activities with Chile will be done through the Sociedad Chilena de
Astronomia (SOCHIAS) --- the society that gathers all the professional
astronomers in the country.

SOCHIAS has designated Eduardo Unda-Sanzana as the main contact
person for TF1 tasks, Cristian Cort\'es for TF2 tasks and Patricio
Rojo for TF3 tasks inside Chile. Farid Char is a staff member at the
Unidad de Astronomía of the Universidad de Antofagasta who will be
responsible to interface with the rest of the ROAD countries. 


\subsection*{The case of Bolivia}

In Bolivia there is a very small community dedicated to
astronomy. We have contacted three people (Mirko Raljevic, Roc\'io
Guzm\'an and Manuel de la Torre) who will volunteer for the node
activities. However, for the moment we do not have any institution
joining the node.

\section{Brief description of the coordinating institution}

Universidad de los Andes (Uniandes) is located in Bogotá, Colombia. It
is a private University founded in 1946. Currently it is the top
University in Colombia as reported by the QS2014 and Times
Higher Education 2013-2014 University Rankings. It also ranks among
the top 5 in Latin America and the top 300 on a global scale.    

Uniandes hosts a Faculty of Sciences with 5 departments: Biology,
Chemistry, Geosciences, Mathematics and Physics. The Physics
Department has an active graduate school and also hosts postdoctoral
researchers. One of the research groups in the Physics is focused on
Astronomy and Astrophysics, composed by 4 Faculty (3 PhD, 1 MSc) with
research interests in instrumentation, observational astronomy and
computational astrophysics. The Astrophysics Group also manages a
small observatory dedicated mostly to outreach and motivating
undergraduate students into astronomy. 

In July 2013 Universidad de los Andes hosted and gave financial
support to the Workshop Astronomía en los
Andes \footnote{\texttt{http://workshopastronomia.uniandes.edu.co/}}. This
Workshop received researchers from all the countries participating in
this ROAD proposal and also included the participation of the TF2 and
TF3 coordinators in the current proposal. This meeting helped us to
survey the status of Astronomy in the region and design a blueprint
for its development in the region. Submitting the current proposal was
one of the main goals of the workshop.
